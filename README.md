# HCIProject
Human Computer Interaction project about developing multimodal system for Rowing --> GRow
A solution that aims at exploring,facilitating and improving rowing activities.

While some solutions already tried to target rowing sport and still mainly
focused on professional rowers by means of improving performance and strokes per minutes,
we believe it is equally important to help beginners to realize correct and accurate movements.
Furthermore, deep market and system analysis in addition to leveraging the proven practices in
multimodal interface design have shown that the right combination of different sensory
channels, such as auditory and haptic, can lead to enhanced user experience.
